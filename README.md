# Plugins Hieroglyphs.io

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)  

This project allows me to create npm plugins for their reuse by other developers.   

## Description  

This project is more complex than it seems since it uses a CI system which verifies the code through a series of tests, and automatically deploys the plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs.com). These are svg icons that I designed and which will be distributed on a website to allow developers to easily integrate them into their own website.
